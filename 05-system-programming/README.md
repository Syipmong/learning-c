## üéØ Key Concepts

### System Calls
```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

// File operations using system calls
int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
if (fd != -1) {
    char buffer[1024];
    ssize_t bytes_read = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
    if (bytes_read > 0) {
        buffer[bytes_read] = '\0';
        printf("Read: %s\n", buffer);
    }
    close(fd);
}
```

### Process Management
```c
#include <sys/wait.h>

pid_t pid = fork();
if (pid == 0) {
    // Child process
    execl("/bin/ls", "ls", "-l", NULL);
    perror("exec failed");
    exit(1);
} else if (pid > 0) {
    // Parent process
    int status;
    wait(&status);
    printf("Child exited with status %d\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
} else {
    perror("fork failed");
}
```

### Threading
```c
#include <pthread.h>

void* thread_function(void* arg) {
    int thread_id = *(int*)arg;
    printf("Thread %d is running\n", thread_id);
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t threads[4];
    int thread_ids[4];
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        thread_ids[i] = i;
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, thread_function, &thread_ids[i]);
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Network Programming
```c
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>

// TCP Client
int sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
struct sockaddr_in server_addr;
server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
server_addr.sin_port = htons(8080);
inet_pton(AF_INET, "127.0.0.1", &server_addr.sin_addr);

if (connect(sock, (struct sockaddr*)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr)) == 0) {
    send(sock, "Hello Server", 12, 0);
    char buffer[1024];
    recv(sock, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
}
close(sock);
```

## üí° Important Concepts

### System Programming Principles
- **Error Handling**: Always check return values from system calls
- **Resource Management**: Close files, sockets, and free resources
- **Portability**: Handle platform differences gracefully
- **Security**: Validate inputs and handle permissions correctly
- **Performance**: Understand system overhead and optimization

### Process vs Threads
- **Processes**: Separate memory space, expensive to create, robust isolation
- **Threads**: Shared memory space, lightweight, careful synchronization needed
- **Use Cases**: Processes for isolation, threads for concurrent computation

### Synchronization Mechanisms
- **Mutexes**: Mutual exclusion for critical sections
- **Semaphores**: Counting mechanism for resource access
- **Condition Variables**: Wait for specific conditions
