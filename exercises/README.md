## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, you will:

### Phase 1 Objectives
- ✅ Understand C syntax and basic data types
- ✅ Master input/output operations
- ✅ Use all operator types effectively
- ✅ Write conditional logic and decision-making code
- ✅ Implement various loop structures

### Phase 2 Objectives  
- ✅ Design and implement functions
- ✅ Work with arrays and strings efficiently

### Phase 3 Objectives
- ✅ Organize data with structures and unions
- ✅ Handle file input/output operations
- ✅ Process different file formats (text, binary, CSV)
- ✅ Implement error handling strategies
- ✅ Build data persistence applications

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Compilation Errors:**
- Check that GCC is installed and in PATH
- Verify file names match exactly
- For Exercise 6, use `-lm` flag for math library

**Runtime Errors:**
- Check input format matches expected format
- Verify array bounds are not exceeded
- Ensure pointers are properly initialized

**File Not Found:**
- Make sure you're in the exercises directory
- Check file extensions (.c for source files)
- Verify bin directory exists for executables

### Getting Help

1. **Read error messages carefully** - They often point to the exact problem
2. **Check the comments** - Each file has detailed explanations
3. **Start simple** - If stuck, try simpler versions first
4. **Use debugging** - Add printf statements to trace execution
5. **Review related foundation files** - Check the main learning files for concepts
