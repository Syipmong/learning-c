## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed (GCC recommended)
2. Start with the `01-foundations` folder
3. Read the README in each folder for specific instructions
4. Complete exercises before moving to the next phase
5. Build the projects in the `projects/` folder

## 📖 Recommended Resources

- **Books**: "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan & Ritchie
- **Online**: cppreference.com, learn-c.org
- **Tools**: GCC, GDB, Valgrind, Make/CMake

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this journey, you will be able to:
- Write efficient, maintainable C code
- Debug and optimize C programs
- Build scalable applications
- Understand system-level programming
- Transition smoothly to C++
- Apply industry best practices
